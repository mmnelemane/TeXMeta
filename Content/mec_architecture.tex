ETSI establishes a reference framework and architecture to realize MEC as shown below:

The architecture comprises the following 4 components:

1. The MEC host – provides the necessary infrastructure including virtualized resources.

2. The MEC Platform – Provides functionality and interfaces to run applications on top of the MEC host.

3. MEC Management – Handles host and system level management. It can be done at two levels – the host level involving the platform manager and the infrastructure manager and the system level using the MEC Edge orchestrator. 

4. MEC Applications – Are services provided through the MEC architecture some of which can also be provided by the MEC platform manager.
