\section{Open Source Iaas Solutions}

These solutions are responsible to automate the tasks to be performed on the computation resources like Vms and Containers and also provide the necessary backbone infrastructure for the workloads that run on these resources like storage, networking, security, authentication and plumbing services like database, messaging, configuration, concurrency, internationalization, serialization and other general utilities.

In this paper, we discuss the most popular solutions that are also available as open source implementations â€“ OpenStack for the Virtual Machines and Kubernetes for the Containers.
