\section{Conclusion}

Cloud computing, Virtualization and Containerization have enabled commoditization of communication services. The ability to move workloads to virtual machines and containers has helped flexibility and scalability necessary for new types of services. Some of these services would now be able to utilize the computational power and data availability at the edge of the network. There has been humongous efforts in the standards bodies and open source communities in moving the Edge computing technology forward. While OpenStack leverages virtualization technologies, Kubernetes uses containerization to realize the functional blocks of the Edge computing system. The open source solutions try to address the hard requirements through auxiliary projects and optimizations. The middleware layers provide facilities to utilize the underlying optimization in an automated fashion to realize the infrastructure as needed by the application. An important goal of the architectures presented is to make application development as simple as possible by not exposing the complexities of the underlying infrastructure through separation of concerns. The Management plane and Control plane work in tandem with the Application to produce the desired results on the Data Plane.
