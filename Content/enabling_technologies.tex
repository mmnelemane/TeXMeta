\section{Enabling Technologies}

A range of technologies developed over several years have enabled the evolution of NFV and Edge Computing. This seections briefly describes and compares the technologies that led to the development of MEC and its parallel technology NFV.

These technologies can be grouped into 4 different planes based on their functionalities.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data Plane
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item
        \end{itemize}
    \item Control Plane
	\begin{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Management Plane
	\begin{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
    \item Application Plane
	\begin{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These planes are depicted in the figure below[\image{Figure 5}].

The architecture also evolves into multiple business models as envisaged by the NIST Cloud Computing group

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Infrastructure As A Service
    \item Platform as a Service
    \item Software As A Service
\end{enumerate}
